          David Embury was an attorney who wrote a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Mixing_Drinks">famous book</a>
          about cocktails in 1948. He set some absolute classics to paper and came up
          with a few ratios for good drinks (e.g. one sweet : two sour : eight base).

          exploring some of the structure in cocktail recipes, and I hope to share
          what I've found with you soon.
